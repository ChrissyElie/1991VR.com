          <p class="f4-mktg mb-3">When hearing “collapse of the USSR”, many in the Western world think of President Reagan’s speech where he recounted “Mr. Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall!”. Still to this day, people recall believing that these words helped to bring down an entire country, and assumed that its inhabitants were happy to have a democracy in the end.</p>
          <p class="f4-mktg mb-6">But is that really the narrative? What did people go through in the 15 countries that broke out of the Soviet Union? </p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 float-left p-4">
          <p class="h6-mktg mb-3">Narrative</p>

          <p class="f4-mktg mb-3">Suhan Tuyliyev is a composer for the philharmonic orchestra and the head professor at the Turkmen National Conservatory’s Music Composition Department. After the collapse of the USSR, Turkmenistan’s government banned classical music and shut down the orchestra, destroying careers of thousands of talented musicians. </p>
          <p class="f4-mktg mb-6">This documentary explores a father’s experiences from 1991 – present, when he was suppressed in his creativity, but persevered through art and storytelling.</p>

            <p class="f1-mktg">This unique perspective recounts a personal story from Turkmenistan, yet a very commonly shared history of the people’s strain of Post-Soviet countries.</p>
          </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p class="h5-mktg mt-6 mb-6">Act I - The Collapse</p>

      <p class="f4-mktg mb-6">The documentary takes place in Tuyliyev’s office in Turkmenistan. The physical installation will emulate his office, where the guest will learn about the collapse of the USSR and meet the main characters of the story. </p>

      <p class="h5-mktg mt-6 mb-6">Act II - Memories</p>

      <p class="f4-mktg mb-6">This act is about Suhan Tuyliyev’s depression, as the ghost of the banned orchestra enters the office to haunt him.

      <p class="f4-mktg mb-3">This act is about Suhan Tuyliyev’s depression, as the ghost of the banned orchestra enters the office to haunt him. 
      </p>
      <p class="f4-mktg mb-6">This past June 2019, we recorded a 22-musician string orchestra in Turkmenistan utilizing Depth Kit Volumetric Capture System. Production was broken down to two parts. First we recorded the orchestra’s audio. Once we captured the best sound and performance, we invited each musician, one at a time, to record the Depth Kit footage.</p>

      <p class="h5-mktg mt-6 mb-6">Act IV - Transition</p>

      <p class="f4-mktg mb-6">While the orchestra is performing Suhan Tuyliyev’s piece, the walls of the room get consumed by a three dimensional kaleidoscope that comes out of the piano’s cap. This signifies the transition between Suhan’s depression and his coming back to composing.</p>

      <p class="h5-mktg mt-6 mb-6">Act V - Awakening</p>

      <p class="f4-mktg mb-6">In 2009 the second President of Turkmenistan abolished the ban of classical music, the orchestra and opera were allowed to revive. This act is immersing the viewer in a live painted VR mural, telling an ancient Turkmen tale about the power of music. This scene is a metaphor for Suhan Tuyliyev healing from depression by returning to his craft. Suhan’s daughter Dr. Maya Tuylieva will perform the Third Movement of his Second Piano Sonata, as the “Uzuklar” VR mural unravels around the viewer. This autobiographical piano piece was written after the ban was repealed. It depicts human struggle and celebration of life.</p>
